# kanna-beta-VN
- First draft of a visual novel type game
- Ultimately scrapped due to story conflicts and being too grimdark

## Storyline

Since no one is going to read this but me, I'll just ramble a bit. Before I rewrote Kanna's story, it initially followed the descent of a girl into a cult town.
Through user choices, Kanna would be given the decision to either sacrifice her own life to appease the cult and become their god or kill all the cult members to escape.
The main two routes would be "ascention to godhood" and "return to humanity," the former being to discard her life to become a god and the latter being to 
submit to human nature and kill to subvert her fate. The routes would usually be determined by options that can essentially be boiled down to 
"I'll do what you say" and "screw you, I'll do what I want."

## Character Details
Characters are obviously really important to me. I found that these renditions of my characters were really bland and confining. This is really just for documentation.

### Kanna
- The human sacrifice who was kidnapped by the townspeople.
- A teenage girl, probably 16, it's only fitting
- Typical inquisitive aimless MC
- Responsible and caring or defiant depending on playstyle

### End
- The cult spokesperson (not actually the leader, but that was supposed to be a secret)
- Purposefully annoying, conniving man
- Kind of unhinged, murder is second nature, he does it for the greater good
- Would probably have a crazy Komaeda moment

### Fragmentor
- The cult leader (once again a secret)
- Obligatory depressed sadboy (i made him too soft in this rendition. i don't like it)
- Behind-the-scenes role of paperwork and dissecting bodies of course

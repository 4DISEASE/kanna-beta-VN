# kanna-beta-VN
- First draft of a visual novel type game
- Ultimately scrapped due to story conflicts and being too grimdark
- The assets and scripts are way too messy, don't look for your own good
- Also the sprites are kind of funny looking

## Storyline

Since no one is going to read this but me, I'll just ramble a bit. Before I rewrote Kanna's story, it initially followed the descent of a girl into a cult town.
Through user choices, Kanna would be given the decision to either sacrifice her own life to appease the cult and become their god or kill all the cult members to escape.
The main two routes would be "ascention to godhood" and "return to humanity," the former being to discard her life to become a god and the latter being to 
submit to human nature and kill to subvert her fate. The routes would usually be determined by options that can essentially be boiled down to 
"I'll do what you say" and "screw you, I'll do what I want."

## Character Details
Characters are obviously really important to me. I found that these renditions of my characters were really bland and confining. This is really just for documentation.

### Kanna
- The human sacrifice who was kidnapped by the townspeople.
- A teenage girl, probably 16, it's only fitting
- Typical inquisitive aimless MC
- Responsible and caring or defiant depending on playstyle

### End
- The cult spokesperson (not actually the leader, but that was supposed to be a secret)
- Purposefully annoying, conniving man
- Kind of unhinged, murder is second nature, he does it for the greater good
- Would probably have a crazy Komaeda moment

### Fragmentor
- The cult leader (once again a secret)
- Obligatory depressed sadboy
- Behind-the-scenes role of paperwork and dissecting bodies of course
- One-sided affection towards End (???)

### Annie
- Woman who slaughters?
- Into taxidermy
- Apparently complies to the rule of the cult strictly
- I don't really know. She wasn't fleshed out that much

### Harold and Elizabeth
- Two orphans who live on the town grounds
- Secretly two emissaries from god?
- Some weird thing about justice. With balance imagery...

### Lucien
- Washed up ex-soldier
- Has shellshock, alerted by loud noises
- Cares deeply for his wife (Alice) who is like... a corpse preserved in a tube
- Deep down is a nice guy but he has problems
